bugfixes:
- "mysql_user - fix the possibility for a race condition that breaks certain (circular) replication configurations when ``DROP USER`` is executed on multiple nodes in the replica set. Adding ``IF EXISTS`` avoids the need to use ``sql_log_bin: no`` making the statement always replication safe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/287)."
