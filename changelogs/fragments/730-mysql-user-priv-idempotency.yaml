bugfixes:
  - mysql_user - the module was not idempotent in check mode on MariaDB when the order of provided privileges did not match the canonical order returned by the database. The module now sorts privileges before comparison to fix this. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/730)
