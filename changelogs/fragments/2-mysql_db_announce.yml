minor_changes:
- mysql_db - add the ``pipefail`` argument to avoid broken dumps when ``state`` is ``dump`` and compression is used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/256).

major_changes:
- mysql_db - the ``pipefail`` argument's default value will be changed to ``true`` in community.mysql 4.0.0. If your target machines do not use ``bash`` as a default interpreter, set ``pipefail`` to ``false`` explicitly. However, we strongly recommend setting up ``bash`` as a default and ``pipefail=true`` as it will protect you from getting broken dumps you don't know about (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/407).
