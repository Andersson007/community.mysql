breaking_changes:
- mysql_user - the ``column_case_sensitive`` argument's default value has been changed to ``true``. If your playbook expected the column to be automatically uppercased for your users privileges, you should set this to ``false`` explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/577).
